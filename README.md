# Twisted ElGamal Non-Interactive Schnorr Chaum-Pedersen protocol implementation.

Using Twisted ElGamal encryption, this library implements a Non-Interactive version of the Chaum-Pedersen protocol using Fiat-Shamir Heuristics for Zero Knowledge, over an abstract cyclic group (G,+) using Ristretto Group with Curve25519. The library used in this implementation for the construction of the Ristretto Group is curve25519-dalek.

## The problem

### Twisted ElGamal Non-Interactive Chaum/Pedersen protocol
Consider cyclic Group $(\mathcal{G}, +)$ of prime order q with generator G and H with fixed and secret domain separator (hidden dependence).\
For Key Generation $x \xleftarrow{\\$} \mathbb{Z}_q, Y = x*G$,

With message in scalar form m, it encodes $M = m*G \in \mathcal{G}$.

Encryption is as follows:\
$k \xleftarrow{\\$} Z_q$, \
$C_1 = k*G, C_2 = M + k*Y$ \
Ciphertext $CT = (C_1, C_2)$

Decryption:\
Compute $S' = x*C_1 = x*k*G = k*x*G = k*Y$\
$C_2 - S' = M + k*Y - k*Y = M = m*G$\
Then solves the discrete logarithm (theoretical) of $M = m*G$ to recover m

Goal:\
Given a Public Key, a Commitment and a Ciphertext prove:\
There exist scalars m, r and k such that:\
$C_m = m*G + r*H$, $C_1 = k*G$, $C_2 = M + k*Y$  // This statement hides M = m*G with domain separated H and randomly generated r, while encrypting the same original m of the message. +
 
Statement and witnesses:\
Public: G, H, Y, $C_m$, $C_1$, $C_2$\
Witnesses: $m, r, k \in Z_q$

$$C_m = m*G + r*H$$\
$C_1 = k*G$\
$C_2 = M + k*Y$

### Multi-relation Sigma Protocol (P, V):
Prover P chooses random $\alpha, \beta, \gamma \xleftarrow{\\$} Z_q$\
and defines:\
$$T_1 = \gamma*G$$\
$T_2 = \alpha*G + \gamma*Y$\
$T_3 = \alpha*G + \beta*H$

Computes Fiat-Shamir challenge for the Non-Interactive construction:\
$e = Hash(G, H, Y, C_m, C_1, C_2, T_1, T_2, T_3)$
 
and responds with scalars:\
$s_m = \alpha + e*m, s_r = \beta + e*r, s_k = \gamma + e*k$
 
Validator V checks:\
$s_k*G =? T_1 + e*C_1$\
$s_m*G + s_k*Y =? T_2 + e*C_2$\
$s_m*G + S_r*H =? T_3 + e*C_m$\
and accepts if they all hold, otherwise it rejects

Properties:\
Completeness: check for generic variables\
Special soundness: Two accepting transcripts with same initial $T_1, T_2, T_3$ and different challenges extracts the openings (m, r, k)\
Honest validator zero-knowledge (HVSK): From an accepting transcript, we can simulate $T_1, T_2, T_3$ from totally random $s_m, s_r, s_k \xleftarrow{\$} Z_q$ and post hoc e, proving no aditional information is leaked.\
Non-Interactive zero-knowledge (NISK): Given by HVSK and the Fiat-Shamit heuristics.

### Sigma Protocol (P,V) for Verifiable Decryption (Chaum-Pedersen):
 Proves that $log_G(C1) = log_Y(C2 - M)$
 
Prover P choose $t \xleftarrow{\\$} Z_q$ and sends:\
$\xleftarrow{A = t*G, B = y*Y}$\
Validator V sends a challenge $e \xleftarrow{\\$} Z_q$\
$\xrightarrow{e}$
$\xleftarrow{z = t + e*k}$\
V verifies $z*G =? A + e*C_1, z*Y =? B + (C_2 - M)$\
If both conditions hold, accepts, otherwise rejects.

 Completeness, special soundness, HVSK and NISK given by the Multi-relation Sigma Protocol with Fiat-Shamir heuristics.
